# Python_Game
The snake game is well known all around the world as one of simplest and yet most fun games, with its creation from around 1976 for the arcades, but getting even more famous when it came to mobile phones. The game consists in a snake eating fruits and getting bigger and bigger and avoiding hiting the walls and itself, for its own sake.

# Creation of the code
This version of the game was all coded in Python and, as I am new to Python language, I followed a tutorial made by a channel on youtube named Clear Code (https://www.youtube.com/ClearCode).
